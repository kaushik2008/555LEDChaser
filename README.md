# 555LEDChaser
555 LED Chaser project for Hack Club's Blueprint Challenge. The project is a 555 LED Chaser board with 10 leds aka a “Blinky Board”. I roughly followed this tutorial (but changed a few components: https://blueprint.hackclub.com/starter-projects/blinky)

Here is a schematic and 3d view of the final PCB design:
